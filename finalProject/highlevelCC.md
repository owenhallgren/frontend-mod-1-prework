First I would make an array of every letter in the alphabet in alphabetical order. This is where we store the letters each assigned to its corresponding index. Then I would use a function input and get the string. Then find each letter in the strings corresponding index in the alphabet array and then shift that index three to the left by subtracting three from the index and log. If the resulting index is less than zero, I would add the negative index to 25 which would result in its new index. This is used because A,B,C would go negative when moving 3 spots left. I would then log the result in a new string.
