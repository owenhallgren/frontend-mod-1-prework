## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
I found I did better if I worked in longer chunks and took longer breaks. I have a hard taking a small break and jumping right back into what I am doing. If I work longer in a 50 minute chunk, and take a 10 minute break I found I work better and more efficiently.  
1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
I was defiantly more focused when I timed myself out. When I broke the work into small chunks and small steps I was able to focus more on what was immediately in front of me. One issue I had was when I was deep in thought and figuring out a problem if the timer went off I would really lose my focus. I like the idea of the Pomodoro technique but I defiantly need to do some work to implement it and have it work better with my style.
1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An object is used to store data, it is used to store more complex data than an array. An array is a simple ordered list of data, that data can be called upon by using the index of the item. Objects can have data called by strings. This is important because you can store more complex data and further manipulate it.
1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  An array, this is just a simple list of names and doesn't hold complex data.
  * List of states and their capitals
  An object, if we store it as an object we can pair the capitals and states they belong too.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  Array, again this is just a simple list of strings.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  I think this could go either way, if it just the names then an array is effective. But if other information is being stored such as a link to the account it would be better to store it as an object.
  * List of student names and their cohort
  Object, by storing this as an object we can pair the names and the cohort they belong to together.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  Object, storing this as an object allows us to pair the amount of each ingredient needed with the ingredient itself.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  An array, if it is just a simple list of strings then we don't need to store any complex data so a simple array would work.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
I am using Spotify a lot and I can think of a few examples of objects. For example a playlist, playlists have complex information that needs to be stored, so you would use an object as opposed to an array. Even individual songs could be stored as an object, there is a lot of information attached to a song that would be much better suited for an object than an array. 
1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
