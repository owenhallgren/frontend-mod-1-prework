## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it? The first thing that stuck with me was how I should be reading more often. When I was younger I would go through about a book a week. I slowed down this habbit to almost a halt throughout highschool. I really want to get back into the swing of things with reading. I also wanted to start implementing better breaks throughout my work. I am going to start timing myself for 40 minutes followed by a 5-10 minute break. I need to do research on what constitutes a good break and implement that as well.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
String: A string is plain text that is shown exactly how it is. This is defined by being wrapped in quotes.
Integer/Number/Float: An integer is used to define a number, when there is a decimal it is called a float.
Boolean: Boolean is a value that can be returned as either true or false.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log('Hello World!')

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
"//" This is when you want to add text that is completely ignored by javascript and won't be interpreted as code.
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is used to define a data type that can be used in the code. I would tell a five year old that a variable is like a nickname you use when you talk about something so you don't have to say the full name.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
Instagram
var username = 'string'
var likes = integer
var followers = [array]
7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
A concatenation is used to pull different variables and put them together to form one line.
8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
When ordering something from an online store it sometimes says 'In your cart you have x, x, and x'. They have to pull these down and put them in one string with concatention.
9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
I've been wondering how using code comments in a real world scenario would look like in a workplace.
