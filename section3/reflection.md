## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
One point that stuck with me was imposter syndrome. I hadn't heard that term before and I researched it and was suprised by what I came up with. I've felt that way many times before and I'm sure I will still feel that way in the future, but now I am able to recognize it and this should help me overcome it in the future. Another point that really resonated with me was setting S.M.A.R.T goals. Often when I am working on learning something I don't really set measurable goals for myself. I think being able to see progress and show myself that I am learning is just as important as the learning itself.
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I think one way I have a growth mindset is that I am not deterred to ask questions. I understand that asking questions, or dumb questions, can really help your process. Sometimes another perspective doesn't just help you solve a problem it can also change the way you approach problems and learn new methods. One thing I defiantly need to improve on is my perspective on facing challenges. I am not not opposed to a challenge but I also don't choose to face them. I need to change my mindset and be excited and search for challenges, to better myself.   
1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
Spotify, when you have all your songs in a playlist this is probably in an array. It would just be way too much work to store all of the songs individually, and when you add or remove a song you can just use the pop or push method.
1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method is used to edit an array without having to do it manually. You can add or remove anything from the array with a method.
1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
A loops purpose is to cycle through information and do something with that information based on if requirements are met. The main purpose is so we don't have to type out individual code 'n' number of times and just tell the loop our boundaries. We use a loop in conjunction with an array when we have to something to multiple pieces of data at once.  
1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
We are asking the computer to see if something is true or false. If it is true the computer does one thing. If it is false the computer does another thing. We ask the computer to do this until there are no more things to check.
1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
I am still a little confused about when to use the different kind of loops.
